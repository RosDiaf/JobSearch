        content: `Tech pros who interact in any way with cybersecurity will face a new,
        potentially devastating challenge in the next few years: artificial intelligence.<br /><br />
        According to a new paper by researchers at the nonprofit organization OpenAI, A.I. has a “dual nature.”
        When it comes to security, A.I. is capable of improving filters, surveillance tools, and risk assessments;
        but in the wrong hands, it could also strengthen malware and other software used to penetrate and destroy networks and data.<br /><br />
        OpenAI’s mission is to create “safe” A.I. In order to achieve that lofty goal,
        it publishes papers and open-source software tools that it hopes will guide A.I. research in a positive direction.
        Those tools include OpenAI Gym, a kit for building reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
        which help bots refine decision-making processes.<br /><br />
        “We should take steps as a community to better evaluate research projects for perversion by malicious actors,
        and engage with policymakers to understand areas of particular sensitivity,”
        the researchers wrote in the introduction to the security paper.
        “A.I. is going to alter the global threat landscape, so we should involve a broader cross-section of society in discussions.”
        Those “broader” groups include not only consumers and businesses, but also national security experts and ethicists.<br /><br />
        Among OpenAI’s proposed solutions for heading off A.I.-powered cyberattacks: having “pre-publication risk assessments”
        for certain kinds of research, which could include sharing data among a small group of “trusted organizations.”
        A focus on “norms” that are “responsive to dual-use concerns” could also help the research
        community minimize threats before they become fully weaponized.
        That’s in addition to taking lessons from traditional cybersecurity, such as instituting
        “red teams” that can test A.I. systems for vulnerabilities.<br /><br />
        The big question in all this is a straightforward one: would the tech firms investing in A.I. freely open up their code and research
        for inspection? OpenAI itself has pledged to keep things as transparent as possible,
        stating on its website: “We will not keep information private for private benefit.”
        However, it acknowledged in that same posting: “In the long term,
        we expect to create formal processes for keeping technologies private when there are safety concerns.”<br /><br />
        In theory, companies could prove rather tight-lipped about their A.I., potentially opening the door to hackers to find and exploit
        unannounced vulnerabilities. That could result in a future threat landscape
        that closely mirrors the one we face now with “conventional” software. If you’re involved in cybersecurity, be prepared.<br /><br />`

        content: `Can you have a successful career as a software engineer if you don’t have a formal computer science degree?<br /><br />
        The answer is “yes,” according to Spencer Cornelia and Sylvester Morgan. Cornelia has a bachelor’s degree in sports management
        and currently works as a software QA engineer for Shift4 Corporation.
        Morgan doesn’t have a university degree and currently works as a software engineer on the BI Team at Quicken Loans.<br /><br />
        What’s even more amazing is that they transitioned from technical novices into junior
        software engineers while holding down full-time jobs.<br /><br />
        We’re not suggesting it’s easy, or that having a CS degree isn’t beneficial,
        but both pros say that aspiring software engineers can complete an accelerated training program,
        build some projects, and start competing for entry-level positions within about 12 to 24 months.<br /><br />
        Here’s a look at their four-step career-change process and tips for making a successful transition.
        <h3>Design Your Own ‘Degree’</h3>
        To execute a successful transition, start by figuring out which skills you absolutely need to learn.
        Don’t try to learn a bunch of different programming languages and frameworks that you will probably never use.
        Study job postings and CS college curriculums in order to build a personalized list of must-have skills,
        along with a set of potential courses that will address your specific learning and career goals.<br /><br />
        “It helps to know which specialty you want to pursue, such as web development, mobile development,
        BI etc.,” Morgan said. If you’re not sure, take an intro to programming course that covers algorithms,
        data structures and design patterns, testing and the software development lifecycle
        before you decide which programming languages you need to learn.<br /><br />`

        title: 'Job Interview Questions for OpenStack Developers',

        content: `The cloud has fueled the popularity of the OpenStack platform,
        as well as demand for developers and architects who have experience with its compute,
        storage and networking capabilities. Salaries for professionals with OpenStack skills
        have risen steadily over the past few years.<br /><br />
        When searching for OpenStack candidates, Ruchi Bhargava, director of datacenter and cloud software engineering
        at Intel’s Open Source Technology Center, focuses on logical thinkers who are familiar with open-source programs.
        Here are some of the questions she asks during an interview:<br /><br />
        <h4>How would you perform an upgrade from one OpenStack release to another?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What Most People Say:</strong> “I’m not sure, because I haven’t done one before. But I’ve heard that OpenStack upgrades are difficult.”</li>
            <li><strong>What You Should Say:</strong> “There’s no doubt that OpenStack upgrades can be difficult. For instance,
            I was involved in an Icehouse upgrade at my last company. Although we followed the recommended processes,
            I ended up creating and deploying several Band Aid scripts to minimize downtime and conduct cleanup.
            However, we were willing to withstand the pain since Icehouse is supposed to provide some support for rolling upgrades
            of compute nodes between OpenStack releases.”</li>
            <li><strong>Why You Should Say It:</strong> A top-notch developer recognizes when an upgrade is necessary,
            and how to minimize downtime.</li>
        </ul>`
