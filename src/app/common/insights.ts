        content: `Tech pros who interact in any way with cybersecurity will face a new,
        potentially devastating challenge in the next few years: artificial intelligence.<br /><br />
        According to a new paper by researchers at the nonprofit organization OpenAI, A.I. has a “dual nature.”
        When it comes to security, A.I. is capable of improving filters, surveillance tools, and risk assessments;
        but in the wrong hands, it could also strengthen malware and other software used to penetrate and destroy networks and data.<br /><br />
        OpenAI’s mission is to create “safe” A.I. In order to achieve that lofty goal,
        it publishes papers and open-source software tools that it hopes will guide A.I. research in a positive direction.
        Those tools include OpenAI Gym, a kit for building reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
        which help bots refine decision-making processes.<br /><br />
        “We should take steps as a community to better evaluate research projects for perversion by malicious actors,
        and engage with policymakers to understand areas of particular sensitivity,”
        the researchers wrote in the introduction to the security paper.
        “A.I. is going to alter the global threat landscape, so we should involve a broader cross-section of society in discussions.”
        Those “broader” groups include not only consumers and businesses, but also national security experts and ethicists.<br /><br />
        Among OpenAI’s proposed solutions for heading off A.I.-powered cyberattacks: having “pre-publication risk assessments”
        for certain kinds of research, which could include sharing data among a small group of “trusted organizations.”
        A focus on “norms” that are “responsive to dual-use concerns” could also help the research
        community minimize threats before they become fully weaponized.
        That’s in addition to taking lessons from traditional cybersecurity, such as instituting
        “red teams” that can test A.I. systems for vulnerabilities.<br /><br />
        The big question in all this is a straightforward one: would the tech firms investing in A.I. freely open up their code and research
        for inspection? OpenAI itself has pledged to keep things as transparent as possible,
        stating on its website: “We will not keep information private for private benefit.”
        However, it acknowledged in that same posting: “In the long term,
        we expect to create formal processes for keeping technologies private when there are safety concerns.”<br /><br />
        In theory, companies could prove rather tight-lipped about their A.I., potentially opening the door to hackers to find and exploit
        unannounced vulnerabilities. That could result in a future threat landscape
        that closely mirrors the one we face now with “conventional” software. If you’re involved in cybersecurity, be prepared.<br /><br />`

        content: `Can you have a successful career as a software engineer if you don’t have a formal computer science degree?<br /><br />
        The answer is “yes,” according to Spencer Cornelia and Sylvester Morgan. Cornelia has a bachelor’s degree in sports management
        and currently works as a software QA engineer for Shift4 Corporation.
        Morgan doesn’t have a university degree and currently works as a software engineer on the BI Team at Quicken Loans.<br /><br />
        What’s even more amazing is that they transitioned from technical novices into junior
        software engineers while holding down full-time jobs.<br /><br />
        We’re not suggesting it’s easy, or that having a CS degree isn’t beneficial,
        but both pros say that aspiring software engineers can complete an accelerated training program,
        build some projects, and start competing for entry-level positions within about 12 to 24 months.<br /><br />
        Here’s a look at their four-step career-change process and tips for making a successful transition.
        <h3>Design Your Own ‘Degree’</h3>
        To execute a successful transition, start by figuring out which skills you absolutely need to learn.
        Don’t try to learn a bunch of different programming languages and frameworks that you will probably never use.
        Study job postings and CS college curriculums in order to build a personalized list of must-have skills,
        along with a set of potential courses that will address your specific learning and career goals.<br /><br />
        “It helps to know which specialty you want to pursue, such as web development, mobile development,
        BI etc.,” Morgan said. If you’re not sure, take an intro to programming course that covers algorithms,
        data structures and design patterns, testing and the software development lifecycle
        before you decide which programming languages you need to learn.<br /><br />`

        content: `The cloud has fueled the popularity of the OpenStack platform,
        as well as demand for developers and architects who have experience with its compute,
        storage and networking capabilities. Salaries for professionals with OpenStack skills
        have risen steadily over the past few years.<br /><br />
        When searching for OpenStack candidates, Ruchi Bhargava, director of datacenter and cloud software engineering
        at Intel’s Open Source Technology Center, focuses on logical thinkers who are familiar with open-source programs.
        Here are some of the questions she asks during an interview:<br /><br />
        <h4>How would you perform an upgrade from one OpenStack release to another?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What Most People Say:</strong> “I’m not sure, because I haven’t done one before. But I’ve heard that OpenStack upgrades are difficult.”</li>
            <li><strong>What You Should Say:</strong> “There’s no doubt that OpenStack upgrades can be difficult. For instance,
            I was involved in an Icehouse upgrade at my last company. Although we followed the recommended processes,
            I ended up creating and deploying several Band Aid scripts to minimize downtime and conduct cleanup.
            However, we were willing to withstand the pain since Icehouse is supposed to provide some support for rolling upgrades
            of compute nodes between OpenStack releases.”</li>
            <li><strong>Why You Should Say It:</strong> A top-notch developer recognizes when an upgrade is necessary,
            and how to minimize downtime.</li>

        title: 'Google Offering Crash Course in Machine Learning',
        author: 'Nick Kolakowski',

        content: `Is your CEO suddenly repeating the phrase “artificial intelligence” over and over again?
        Are your clients jabbering endlessly about making an app “smarter”? If so, you might need to take a crash course in machine learning,
        the skillset that will enable you to create software that refines itself over the course of many iterations.<br /><br />
        Google is now offering such a course, complete with 25 lessons and more than 40 exercises, all of it designed for completion
        in 15 hours (or conceivably less, if you already have some of the necessary knowledge).
        There are lots of videos of Google engineers describing the nuances of machine learning,
        but the course is ultimately independent, so you’ll need to be good at self-learning in order to make your way through it.<br /><br />
        Topics covered include training and test sets, validation, regularization, logic regression, classification, and training neural nets.
        There are some examples of machine learning at work in the real world, including a five-minute video on cancer prediction.<br /><br />
        Even if you don’t have an immediate need for machine-learning knowledge, adopting the technology into your toolkit is probably
        a good idea over the long term. Machine-learning algorithms can do everything from improve the driving accuracy of autonomous
        vehicles to boost network cybersecurity (or, conversely, help unleash a new age of exceptionally brutal cyberattacks); tech pros,
        recognizing the power of the technology to change the world, have been rushing to learn more about it.
        (On that note: a new study from GitHub shows that developers are increasingly interested in machine-learning
        and deep-learning platforms such as TensorFlow.)<br /><br />
        In response to that burgeoning demand, companies such as Google are studying how to best automate A.I. and machine-learning systems
        so that a broader range of workers can utilize them. However automated those technologies become, though,
        chances are good that anyone working with A.I. and machine learning will need to know at least the basics of the technology
        in order to perform a job; hence the need for education along the lines of Google’s new crash course.<br /><br />`

        content: `Open-source hosting platform GitHub is trying to predict the (short term) future of technology:
        It’s released a new study and guidance on what trends will dominate the upcoming year.<br /><br />
        GitHub isn’t throwing darts blindly. Over 24 million people around the globe engaged with at least 25 million public
        GitHub repositories in 2017; the company analyzed how users interacted with those projects in order to predict what’s coming.
        Here’s how it describes the methodology:<br /><br />
        We looked at three different types of activity. First, we identified the top 100 projects that had at least 2,000 contributors
        in 2016 and experienced the largest increase in contributors in 2017. We also identified the top 100 projects that received
        the largest increase in visits to the project’s repo in 2017. Finally, we identified the top 100 projects
        that received the most new stars in 2017. Combining these lists, we categorized projects into broad communities and looked
        at the communities that were the most represented at the top of the lists.<br /><br />
        Cross-platform and web development continue to interest developers; the Angular/Angular-cli repository doubled its interaction
        versus the year prior. GitHub says users in 2017 “visited, starred and contributed” more often to projects
        such as React, Electron and Angular.<br /><br />
        Developers also like deep learning. The TensorFlow/TensorFlow repository had 2.2 times more visitors in 2017 than 2016,
        and TensorFlow/models saw 5.5 times more interactions. Mozilla’s DeepSpeech repo was likewise popular.
        Not only did users interact with those deep-learning skills more in 2017, but quite a few of those
        repositories were created in the last year, as well.<br /><br />
        But it’s not just about projects. GitHub is seeing a trend emerge around job preparedness and keeping up-to-date on specialized skills,
        and developers have continued brushing up on languages. GitHub points out that the 30 Seconds of Code repository,
        which is a “curated collection of useful JavaScript snippets that you can understand in 30 seconds or less,”
        has seen a lot of engagement. Other popular repos are aimed at interview preparedness,
        while repos that serve as best-practice guides or style sheets for codebases continue to be much-visited.<br /><br />
        All told, 2018 could be a lot like the last half of 2017. After Google, Amazon and Apple made big bets on machine
        learning and artificial intelligence, interest and engagement in those topics ballooned.
        Over the next year, developers will continue to explore what A.I. can do for them.<br /><br />
        Cross-platform projects will never go away, meaning that developers will continue to need to learn new code
        and languages relatively quickly. Happily, people are starting to use GitHub for more than just static code
        repository hosting, and branching out into listicles and best-practices guides that can help them increase their
        knowledge in an expedited way.`
